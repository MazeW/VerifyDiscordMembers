# VerifyDiscordMembers

Simple extension to EssentialsXDiscordLink Minecraft plugin to execute commands and teleport players unpon linking their Discord account with the server

## Usage
Configure config.yml file to your hearts content and make sure that EssentialsXDiscord and EssentialsXDiscordLink are added and configured properly.

### Commands
Command `/reload`

Permission `VerifyDiscordMembers.reload`

Reloads the config file, duh

## Compatibility

Tested on Minecraft 1.21.4 Paper, but since this is a Bukkit plugin probably works with other server types and maybe other versions too, idk.

I am not interested in maintaing this plugin for this or any newer version, if you want, you can compile it yourself.

If you find any bugs, you can open an issue, but don't expect me fixing it and if that upsets you then submit a PR.
